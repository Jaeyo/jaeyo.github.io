      <description>I moved to my current company, NAVER CLOUD, at the end of August last year. When I was in school, I graduated straight through without transfering schools, but since I started working, I&amp;rsquo;ve been changing jobs quite often.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been through this many changes, each time to a different company and a different position, and it makes me think that changing jobs is like traveling. It&amp;rsquo;s a journey of leaving familiar neighborhoods and people and meeting new cultures in new places.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;There comes a point where you have to do more than just develop and implement features.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;You can be a people manager or you can be an expert in one area or the other, the choice is yours.&amp;rdquo;
(from https://taetaetae.github.io/2019/07/07/review-first-half-2019/)
These are thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve had for quite some time, since I started working. As a developer, your primary job is to &amp;ldquo;write code that works as intended&amp;rdquo;. But at some point, you need to be able to do more than that, you need to be able to do plus alpha.</description>
